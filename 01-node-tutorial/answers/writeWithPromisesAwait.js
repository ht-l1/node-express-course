// we'll use the fs.promose package

// Then create an async function called writer that takes 0 arguments, and that writes three lines to a file named temp.txt, by calling the writeFile function with await. The Promise version of writeFile takes the same arguments as the one you used in last weekâ€™s exercise 10-fs-sync but will return a Promise instead of a result directly.
// Put the await statements inside a try/catch block!

        const data = await readFile('temp.text', 'utf8');

async function readWrite() {
    await writer();
    await reader();

// Finally, write a line at the bottom of the file that calls the readWrite function. 
readWrite();
