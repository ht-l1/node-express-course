// 11-fs-async.js: This should load the fs module, and use the asynchronous function writeFile to write 3 lines to a file, ./temporary/fileB.txt. 

// First, you need to use the "append" flag for all but the first line. Second, each time you write a line to the file, you need to have a callback, because the writeFile operation is asynchronous. Third, for each line you write, you need to do the write for the line that follows it within the callback - otherwise the operations wonâ€™t happen in order. Put console.log statements at various points in your code to tell you when each step completes. Then run the code. Do the console log statements appear in the order you expect? Run the program several times and verify that the file is created correctly. Here is how you might start:
const { writeFile } = require("fs");

console.log("This is line 1\n");

writeFile("./temporary/fileB.txt", "FirstLine\n", (err, result) => {
    console.log("This is line 2\n");
    if (err) {
        console.log("This error happened: ", err);
    } else {
        writeFile("./temporary/fileB.txt", "FirstLine\n", (err, result) => {
            console.log("This is line 3\n");
            if (err) {
                console.log("This error happened: ", err);
            } else {
                writeFile("./temporary/fileB.txt", "FirstLine\n", (err, result) => {
                    console.log("This is line 4\n");
                    if (err) {
                        console.log("This error happened: ", err);
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }
});
